"""CI latency gate 

A scaled-down, open-loop version of the benchmark that fails the build if the
added p99 on the pass-through path (B - A) exceeds 5 ms. Robust to single-run
noise: median B-A p99 across a few short interleaved runs.

The pass/fail is computed on the **pure-overhead view** (``SELECT 1``), because
that is where pass-through engine cost is actually measurable on this hardware:
in the realistic mix the heavy-aggregation query variance (tens of ms) swamps the
sub-ms engine delta, making B-A p99 noise (we still run a mix cell for shape and
print it, but don't gate on it). Open-loop is preserved in both.

Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = fail, 2 = skipped (no database).
Run:  uv run python -m benchmarks.ci_latency_gate
