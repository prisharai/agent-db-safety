"""Open-loop load generator with HdrHistogram recording

The cardinal rule: requests are issued on a fixed pre-computed schedule at a
target arrival rate; we do NOT wait for response i before sending i+1. Latency is
measured from each request's *intended* send time, so if the harness falls behind
schedule that lateness is counted in the latency (not discarded) -- this is what
avoids coordinated omission.

We also instrument the harness itself so we can prove it is not the bottleneck:
scheduler lateness (actual spawn time vs intended), max in-flight, and achieved
vs target throughput. If the generator can't keep its schedule, the run is
invalid and must be reported as such -- never silently trusted.
