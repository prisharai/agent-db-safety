"""Asynchronous, non-blocking audit log.

A query must NEVER wait on a log write (CLAUDE.md sec. 4). This log is also the
traffic corpus -- a record of real agent-generated SQL paired, where possible,
with the agent's stated task -- which feeds the red/green corpora and
intent-mismatch detection (sec. 10).

Design for the latency budget:

* ``record()`` is a *synchronous, non-blocking* call. It does one cheap thing --
  ``Queue.put_nowait`` -- and returns. It never awaits and never touches disk,
  so a query the agent is waiting on never pays for logging. The query path
  calls this and moves on.
* A single background consumer task drains the queue and writes JSONL. The
  actual disk write happens in a thread (``asyncio.to_thread``) so it never
  blocks the event loop, and therefore never adds latency to *other* in-flight
  queries either.
* If the queue is full we DROP the record (and count it) rather than block.
  Logging is fail-open by design: losing an audit line must never stall or fail
  a query. The dropped-count surfaces the rare case where the writer can't keep
  up so it's visible rather than silent.

This is Day 1 (shadow mode): we log everything and enforce nothing.
