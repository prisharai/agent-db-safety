"""Deterministic, YAML-driven policy engine.

HOT PATH. ``evaluate()`` is pure in-memory rule evaluation -- no I/O, no network,
no LLM (CLAUDE.md sec. 8, Day 3). It blocks the obviously dangerous and allows
the obviously safe, and on a block returns a structured, machine-readable
rejection (reason code, human explanation, suggested fix) so the agent can
self-correct. Policy *loading* (YAML -> ``Policy``) happens once at startup and
is explicitly off the hot path.

Posture (sec. 4):
* **Fail closed on uncertainty for writes.** An unparseable statement can't be
  reasoned about, so it's blocked (we can't prove it's a harmless read).
* **Fail open for reads.** A clean read that breaks no rule is allowed. The
  optional LIMIT auto-injection is a guardrail, not a gate: if rewriting fails
  for any reason we let the original read through rather than block it.
* **Default-deny tables.** When a table allowlist is configured, anything not on
  it is blocked.

This evaluates classifications from ``engine.classifier`` -- it never re-derives
statement facts by string matching (sec. 6).
